This is the getting started guide for Starlight GTM.

## What? Why?

It may seem that adding Google Tag Manager to your Starlight site is trivial. 
It is easy enough to add the snipets to the head and body of your site. 
The first is easy with Starlight's convenient `head` override.
However, there is no base layout access, so you need to override a component.

Here we overide the `<SkipLink />` component to add the GTM script at the top of the page.


## Prerequisites

- A Google Tag Manager account
- A Starlight site

## Installation

1. Install the Starlight GTM package
```bash
pnpm add starlight-gtm
```

  2. Add the GTM script to your site

```typescript title="astro.config.mjs" ins={1,8}
import starlightGTMPlugin from "starlight-gtm";

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: "Starlight GTM",
			plugins: [
        starlightGTMPlugin({ gtmId: "GTM-XXXXXXX" })
      ],
			sidebar: [ ...	],
		}),
	],
});
```
